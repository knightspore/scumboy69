‘SCUM BOY. TRANS 3D Artist. Motion Graphic Designer’. These are the descriptors that are shared on Scum Boy’s Instagram profile. With a distinct style dominated by pastel colours, detached body parts and mannequin-like figures, Scum Boy plays with branding and pop culture references, while building a 3D queer world.

His work reflects on a younger generation’s questioning of established social structures, exploring sex, sexual identities, and drawing from his own experiences and view on the world.
